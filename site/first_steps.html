                <h3>Step 1 - Choosing an instrument</h3>
                <section class="choose fs_text">
                    <p>Before you can start playing you have to get an instrument to play on. Many say as first bass guitar you should get a cheap one. To be honest, it doesn't really matter if you get a cheap one or not, in the beginning they are not going to sound especially different. Buying a cheap one can be a safer bet if you're not sure if you will continue playing. There are also a few of different types to choose from but it doesn't matter so much in the beginning either. Just pick one you think looks good and get started</p>

                <h3>Step 2 - Starting to play</h3>
                <section class="starting fs_text">
                    <p>A good thing about the bass guitar is that it is quite easy and fun to start out with and get used to but don't get fooled into thinking that it is an easy instrument. Start out by just feeling in the instrument and learn how it is to play and hold. Start out with some easy songs which you can find tutorials of online easily and just get feel of playing and switching between frets and strings. Once you get a little used to playing it can be a good idea to start memorizing which tones are which. The bass guitar is mainly playing the root notes of the chords so get to know the fretboard.</p>
